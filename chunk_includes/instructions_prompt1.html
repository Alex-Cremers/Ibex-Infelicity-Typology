       <b>Task:</b>  In this experiment, you will read a series of sentences. Your task will be to place the number from each story on a line by using a slider. Click and drag the slider to place each number in the position that best represents it. Click the button at the bottom of the screen to confirm your placement and proceed to the next number. Please give your response as quickly and accurately as possible.

<p class='target' style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;Montana has the largest population among all US states.&rdquo;</p>
  
  
  <p align="center">Does the sentence sound natural?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a positive answer. Even if the sentence is clearly false, it is well-formed English, and that's all that matters here.</p>

  <p align="center">Does the sentence sound natural?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a negative answer, because the sentence is clearly ill-formed, even though we can guess that its intended meaning is true.</p>

  <li>At the end of the survey, after submitting your responses, you will receive a code to copy into Prolific to validate your participation.</li>
  <li>The survey should take 5 to 10 min.</li>
  <li>Don't forget that we don't care about the meaning of the sentences, only whether they sound natural in English.<\li>
