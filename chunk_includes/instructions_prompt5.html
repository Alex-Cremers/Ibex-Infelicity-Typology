       <b>Task:</b> In this experiment, you will read a series of sentences. Your task will be to judge for each sentence whether someone could in principle believe it to be true. We want to know whether the sentence can describe a coherent thought, independently of whether it contradicts what we know about the real world (after all, many people believe things which are in fact false). We are not just interested in whether someone could utter the sentence, because people sometimes say things they don't genuinely believe, but whether they could actually believe it. Some sentences might not sound like proper English, in which case you should rely on your intuition. You will answer the question &ldquo;Can you imagine someone genuinely believing this?&rdquo; by adjusting a slider between &ldquo;definitely not&rdquo; and &ldquo;definitely&rdquo;.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Example 1</h3>

<p class='target' style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;Texas borders Michigan and Canada.&rdquo;</p>
  
  
  <p class='prompt' align="center">Can you imagine someone genuinely believing this?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a positive answer. The sentence is clearly false, but we could imagine that someone who's very confused about the geography of North America would believe it.</p>

<div style="width: 38em; border: 2px solid black;padding:1em;margin-top:2em;">
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Example 2</h3>

<p class='target' style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;Victor Wembanyama is the tallest NBA player,</br>but he is shorter than his teammates.&rdquo;</p>
  
  
  <p class='prompt' align="center">Can you imagine someone genuinely believing this?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a negative answer, because the sentence contradicts itself. No one could genuinely believe that Wembanyama is at the same time the tallest player and shorter than any of his teammates, who area also NBA players.</p>

<p>Before you start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will give your responses using a slider. The slider follows your cursor and clicking validates your answer.</li>
  <li>At the end of the survey, after submitting your responses, you will receive a code to copy into Prolific to validate your participation.</li>
  <li>The survey should take 5 to 10 min.</li>
  <li>Don't forget that we do not care whether the sentences are actually true or false, only whether someone, possibly mistaken, could believe them.</li> 
  <li>If the meaning of a sentence is not entirely clear, follow your intuitions.</li>
