       <b>Task:</b> In this experiment, you will read a series of sentences. Your task will be to judge whether each sentence could in principle be true, even if that meant that the world would have to be different from what it is. We assume that the English language would remain the same (words continue to mean what they mean), but the facts about the world could be completely different, as long as they are consistent. If a sentence is already true in the real world, you should give a positive answer since we can imagine an alternative reality that is almost identical to the current one. Some sentences might not sound like proper English, in which case you should rely on your intuition. You will answer the question &ldquo;Could you imagine this sentence being true if the world was different?&rdquo; by adjusting a slider between &ldquo;definitely not&rdquo; and &ldquo;definitely&rdquo;.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Example 1</h3>

<p class='target' style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;Texas borders Michigan and Canada.&rdquo;</p>
  
  
  <p class='prompt' align="center">Could you imagine this sentence being true if the world was different?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a positive answer. The sentence is clearly false in the real world, but we could imagine an alternative reality where the geography of North America is completely different.</p>

<div style="width: 38em; border: 2px solid black;padding:1em;margin-top:2em;">
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Example 2</h3>

<p class='target' style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;Victor Wembanyama is the tallest NBA player,</br>but he is shorter than his teammates.&rdquo;</p>
  
  
  <p class='prompt' align="center">Could you imagine this sentence being true if the world was different?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a negative answer, because the sentence contradicts itself. We could imagine a reality where Wembanyama is shorter than his teammates, but then he wouldn't be the tallest player anymore.</p>

<p>Before you start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will give your responses using a slider. The slider follows your cursor and clicking validates your answer.</li>
  <li>At the end of the survey, after submitting your responses, you will receive a code to copy into Prolific to validate your participation.</li>
  <li>The survey should take 5 to 10 min.</li>
  <li>If you think that a sentence is already true, you should give a positive answer</li>
  <li>If the meaning of a sentence is not entirely clear, follow your intuitions.</li>
