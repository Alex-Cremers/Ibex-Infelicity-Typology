       <b>Task:</b> In this experiment, you will read a series of sentences. Your task will be to judge whether the meaning of each sentence is clear. We are not interested in whether the sentences are true or false, only whether their meaning is understandable. Some sentences might not sound like proper English, but their intended meaning might still be clear, while some others might not make any sense. You will answer the question &ldquo;Do you understand what the speaker meant?&rdquo; by adjusting a slider between &ldquo;definitely not&rdquo; and &ldquo;definitely&rdquo;.</p>

<div style="width: 38em; border: 2px solid black;padding:1em;margin-top:2em;">
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Example 1</h3>

<p class='target' style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;Oregon population largest US state.&rdquo;</p>
  
  
  <p class='prompt' align="center">Do you understand what the speaker meant?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a somewhat positive answer. Even if the sentence is ill-formed, its meaning seems quite clear (namely, that Oregon is the largest US state in terms of population). Note that the fact that this is false doesn't matter, the only important thing is that we were able to figure out what it means in the first place.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Example 2</h3>

<p class='target' style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;North minus Texas is.&rdquo;</p>
  
  
  <p class='prompt' align="center">Do you understand what the speaker meant?</p>  
  
  <p>In this example, you would give a negative answer, because the sentence does not seem to make any sense.</p>

<p>Before you start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will give your responses using a slider. The slider follows your cursor and clicking validates your answer.</li>
  <li>At the end of the survey, after submitting your responses, you will receive a code to copy into Prolific to validate your participation.</li>
  <li>The survey should take 5 to 10 min.</li>
  <li>Don't forget that we do not care whether the sentences are true or false, only whether you can figure what was meant.</li> 
  <li>You shouldn't spend time looking for a deep meaning, we just want to know whether the sentences make intuitive sense.</li>
</ul>
